# React Code Challenge - Real Estate Listings

An interview code challenge for React candidates.

## Instructions

1. Fork the repo.

2. Install yarn if you don't already have it. <https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/>

3. Install dependencies with `yarn install`.

4. You will be able to start the repo with `yarn start` and access the app at <http://localhost:3100/dashboard>. It should run a Webpack dev server. Note that it is broken right now and will need fixing!

5. Next, you'll create two commits to the master branch in your forked repository.

    For the first commit: Fix issues with the repo. Get it compiling, and try to find as many problems as you can. There are issues and inconsistencies with code formatting rendering and more.

6. For the second commit, you'll extend features of the app from requirements.

    The app is the frontend of a real estate listing service which lists a house image, address, price and description card. This is an open-ended challenge to extend the current functionality according to attached requirements, but you may add any features that you like, such as:

    - ability to add more items
    - update individual items in place after creating them
    - deleting items
    - adding more fields to each item
    - adding drag and drop to reorder items

    Add any extra functionality, animations or libraries you like.

    We don't want to abuse your time, but we'd like to be able to evaluate your skill in styling, building resuable components, and frontend architecture. Make it as simple or complicated as you like, and change whatever you like according to best practices as you know them. We'd suggest that you don't spend more than a few hours on this coding challenge.

    Make sure to add appropriate comments / documentation for your code so it is easy to understand what you've done.
